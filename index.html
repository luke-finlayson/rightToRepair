                                A few decades ago, if something you had broke, you could just fix it or 
                                get your neighbor to do it for you. If none of those were options, then you 
                                could find some local repair shop and they would fix it for you at a cheap price.

                            These days, those options are quickly disapearing, and its becoming harder to 
                            repair electronic equiptment, such as computers, phones and cars.

                            Unfortunatly, this is the result of planned obsolencence. Maunfactures are 
                            deliberatly designing their products to only last a few years at most. They
                            refuse to publish any sort of repair documentation, suggesting that if your product 
                            breaks, you take it to one of their 'authorised' repair shops.

                                The 'Right to Repair' movement was created to stop this from continuing. The people involved 
                                in the movement have been attempting to pass new legistation laws for several years now, however
                                large companys, such as Apple, have been successfully blocking them.
